//Lab 12

I have successfully implemented this lab.  I didn't collaborate with anyone but I utilized the resources linked in the lab12 assignment page.  I spent approximately 5 1/2 hours on this assignment.

For above and beyond points I attempted to build a web application and server using Ruby but I had a lot of trouble with errors.  I finally got stuck on the error "PG::Insufficient Privilege: ERROR: permission denied to create database" but I did notice that until this point, most of the process was very similar to the process with nodejs.  The Procfile differs, specifically it includes a command that runs puma by passing a config file. The Gemfile declares dependencies instead of package.json.  You also use the cammand bundle install instead of npm install.
